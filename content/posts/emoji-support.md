There are nine basic principles of design that data analysts should think about when building their visualizations.  

1. Balance: A data visualization design is balanced by an even distribution of key visual elements such as color and shape. This does not mean that perfect symmetry is required, but one side of the rendering must not interfere with the other. If the data visualization is balanced, the lines used to create the graph can have the same length on both sides, or the objects can have the same distance. 

 
2. Emphasis: You need to focus on visualizing your data so your viewers know what to focus on. In other words, you should highlight the most important data in your visualization so that users see it first. Using colors and values is an effective way to achieve this. Contrasting colors can be used to highlight graphic elements and the data they represent.

3. Movement: It refers to the path the viewer's eyes follow when looking at a visualization of the data, or the literal movement created by the animation. The movement of data visualization needs to mimic the way humans normally read. You can use lines and colors to get the viewer's attention throughout the page.

4. Pattern: You can use similar shapes and colors to create patterns in your data visualization. This can be useful in a lot of different ways. For example, you can use patterns to highlight similarities between different data sets, or break up a pattern with a unique shape, color, or line to create more emphasis.

5. Repetition: Repeating chart types, shapes, or colors adds to the effectiveness of your visualization. Think about the book sales chart from the previous example: the repetition of the colors helps the audience understand that there are distinct sets of data. You may notice this repetition in all of the examples we have reviewed so far. Take some time to review each of the previous examples and notice the elements that are repeated to create a meaningful visual story.

6. Proportion: Proportion is another way that you can demonstrate the importance of certain data. Using various colors and sizes helps demonstrate that you are calling attention to a specific visual over others. If you make one chart in a dashboard larger than the others, then you are calling attention to it. It is important to make sure that each chart accurately reflects and visualizes the relationship among the values in it. 


These first six principles of design are key most importanr considerations that you should make while creating your data visualization. These next three principles are useful checks once your data visualization is finished. If you have applied the initial six principles thoughtfully, then you will probably recognize these next three principles within your visualizations already. 

7. Rhythm: This refers to creating a sense of movement or flow in your visualization. Rhythm is closely tied to the movement principle. If your finished design doesnâ€™t successfully create a flow, you might want to rearrange some of the elements to improve the rhythm.

8. Variety: Your visualizations should have some variety in the chart types, lines, shapes, colors, and values you use. Variety keeps the audience engaged. But it is good to find balance since too much variety can confuse people. The variety you include should make your dashboards and other visualizations feel interesting and unified.

9. Unity: The last principle is unity. This means that your final data visualization should be cohesive. If the visual is disjointed or not well organized, it will be confusing and overwhelming. 

Being a data analyst means learning to think in a lot of different ways. These nine principles of design can help guide you as you create effective and interesting visualizations.
